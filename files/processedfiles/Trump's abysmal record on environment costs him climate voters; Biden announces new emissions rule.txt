    "title": "Trump's abysmal record on environment costs him climate voters; Biden announces new emissions rule",
    "description": "Donald Trump may come to regret defining himself as an enemy of the environment as President Joe Biden pushes significant new climate regulations that make him the clear preference among voters for whom climate change is a priority. Climate activist Bill McKibben, founder of Third Act, talks about Biden's new tailpipe emissions rule and how climate change is being addressed in the 2024 presidential race.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC: https://www.youtube.com/msnbc\n \nFollow MSNBC Show Blogs \nMaddowBlog: https://www.msnbc.com/maddowblog\nReidOut Blog: https://www.msnbc.com/reidoutblog\n\nMSNBC delivers breaking news, in-depth analysis of politics headlines, as well as commentary and informed perspectives.

    "transcript": " there were many bizarre  there were many bizarre things about donald trumps with appliances\n sinks toilets light bulbs  sinks toilets light bulbs but sinks toilets and showers  you dont get any water people are flushing toilets 10w15 times as opposed to once seats showers what goes with that 10 times not me of course  i feel like if you need to flush the toilet 10 times you should speak to your doctor trump was very fixated on the energy efficiency efforts of past administrations even made it a point to roll back more than 100 environmental rules and office know that hes campaigning for a second shot he has a new obsession one with less to do with the bathroom and more to do with the driveway  we are a nation whose leaders are demanding all electric cars despite the fact that they dont go far cost too much and whose batteries are produced in china with materials only available in china on day one i will terminate crooked jobs ridiculous electric vehicle mandate it is so ridiculous  kind of amazing that he still says china like that he has set the electric cars will kill the auto industry and the economy which is not true the car industry has been clear that electric vehicles are the future its the logical economic path and the crucial transition to make if we plan to confront climate change up crisis primarily fueled by oil and gas emissions this is why the latest regulatory move by the current president president biden is a huge deal today the biden administration announced a new role on tailpipe emissions which may not sound monumental but experts are hailing it as the single most important move in the country joining me now is only given thank you for being with us i want to get your take on this because a lot of people that are serious about the climate say we have to change the way we move around we have to think about moving differently than the car obsessed society this seems to be a step in the right direction  for sure put it in context today the world meteorological organization reminded us that 2023 was the hottest year in the last 125000 they issued what they called a red alert for climate change so far 2024 is hotter than 2023 weve got to do something and that means weve got to do something about what in america is one of the biggest sources of omissions transportation cars and trucks this world that biden put forward today is not that strong it relaxes somewhat the trajectory they were on because the uaw auto workers union and others have said maybe we are moving a little too fast he does continue the momentum towards the electrification of our automobile fleet if you think about the things we have to do to deal with climate change this is not a very hard one what we are asking people to do is over the next decade change their current car for one that is probably already cheaper are headed that way it is quieter it has fewer moving parts it costs a lot less to operate that is not a particularly large sacrifice to demand the main sacrifice comes from the fossil fuel industry that wants to keep selling you gas forever so today they announced they were launching a sevenfigure ad campaign in the swing states accusing biden of an electric vehicle mandate which this for better or for worse is not trump you may recall last weekend promised a bloodbath in america the thing he was talking about when he talked about the bloodbath was electric vehicles like it or not climate change and the things we have to do to begin to deal with it is now front and center in this campaign  i think you make an interesting point there are people including yourself that think if we want to take this as seriously as we should it requires massive behavioral change not just behavior but infrastructure so we can use public transit more than our own cars that said this emphasis on electric vehicles will be almost indiscernible to people who make the shift all that happens is you charge your car is supposed to go to the gas station that makes me wonder why donald trump gets so invested in the fact that this is some kind of evil take over by bad people it just doesnt make that much of a difference to most people  as usual the guy has no idea what hes talking about he said the other day that electric vehicles only go 15 miles ive been driving an ev for years and it goes 250 the ones they are building now go 400 or 500 so part of it is that mostly it is the fact that the republican party and these issues for years now has been a whollyowned subsidiary of the fossil fuel industry the biggest threat to them is that people will stop having to fill up all the time looks i hardly even remember how to operate the gas pump anymore i just plug into the wall at home and the price of running that car is much smaller than it was before it is good for me its bad for exxon and that should give you some clue as to why the fossil fuel industry has launched this sevenfigure ad campaign  does this give you confidence i ask you this as a proxy for people who dont think donald trump will be the answer to fighting climate change but are a little bit dissatisfied with the pace at which the biden administration has gone on this despite some major milestones that they have achieved does this feel like movement in the right direction meaningfully are not really  no one is ever moving fast enough but in this case the choice could not be clearer third act this organization for people over 60 endorsed biden this weekend one of the biggest reasons was because it is abundantly clear that if we elect donald trump it will be a full on count the break halt to the momentum that has developed around renewable energy it is not that biden is doing anything right hes not because hes in a politically constrained and i remit but he is reorienting our society in the right direction beginning to spend the money that we need and given four more years will probably make some serious progress the contrast between that and the guy who remember pulled us out of the paris climate accords last time the guy that told us that global warming was a hoax invented by the chinese how many floods and fires and "
